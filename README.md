# OADP CLI

[![Cross-Architecture Build Test](https://github.com/migtools/oadp-cli/actions/workflows/cross-arch-build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/migtools/oadp-cli/actions/workflows/cross-arch-build-test.yml)

A kubectl plugin for working with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) resources, including NonAdminBackup operations.

> This project provides a `kubectl` plugin CLI that extends OADP functionality, allowing users to work with both regular Velero resources and NonAdminBackup resources through a unified interface.

## Features

- **Regular OADP operations**: Standard Velero backup, restore, and version commands
- **NonAdmin operations**: Create and manage NonAdminBackup resources for namespace-scoped backup operations
- **Automatic namespace detection**: NonAdminBackup automatically uses your current kubectl context namespace
- **Kubectl plugin integration**: Works seamlessly as a kubectl plugin

## Command Structure

```
oadp
â”œâ”€â”€ backup (Velero backups)
â”œâ”€â”€ restore (Velero restores) 
â”œâ”€â”€ version
â””â”€â”€ nonadmin
    â””â”€â”€ backup
        â””â”€â”€ create
```

## Installation

### Using Krew (Recommended)

[Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) is the recommended way to install kubectl plugins.

```sh
# Install Krew if you haven't already
kubectl krew install krew

# Install the OADP plugin
kubectl krew install oadp

# Verify installation
kubectl oadp --help
```

**Note:** The LICENSE file is automatically extracted during Krew installation and available in the plugin directory.

## Build and Install

### Quick Installation

Use the Makefile for easy build and installation:

```sh
# Build and install the kubectl plugin
make install
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Build the CLI:**
   ```sh
   make build
   ```

2. **Install as kubectl plugin:**
   ```sh
   sudo mv kubectl-oadp /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```sh
   kubectl oadp --help
   ```

### Development Workflow

```sh
# Build and test locally
make build
./kubectl-oadp --help

# Run tests
make test

# Check status
make status

# View all available commands
make help
```

### Release Process

For maintainers creating releases:

```sh
# Build release archives for all platforms (includes LICENSE file)
make release

# Generate Krew plugin manifest with SHA256 checksums
make krew-manifest

# Clean up build artifacts
make clean
```

The release process creates:
- Platform-specific archives (`kubectl-oadp-OS-ARCH.tar.gz`) containing the binary and LICENSE file
- SHA256 checksums for each archive
- A Krew plugin manifest file with proper checksums for distribution

## Usage Examples

### NonAdminBackup Operations

```sh
# Create a non-admin backup of the current namespace
kubectl oadp nonadmin backup create my-backup

# Create backup with specific resource types
kubectl oadp nonadmin backup create my-backup --include-resources deployments,services

# Create backup excluding certain resources
kubectl oadp nonadmin backup create my-backup --exclude-resources secrets

# View backup YAML without creating it
kubectl oadp nonadmin backup create my-backup --snapshot-volumes=false -o yaml

# Wait for backup completion
kubectl oadp nonadmin backup create my-backup --wait
```

### Regular OADP Operations

```sh
# Work with regular Velero backups
kubectl oadp backup --help

# Work with restores
kubectl oadp restore --help

# Check version
kubectl oadp version
```

## Key Features of NonAdminBackup

- **Namespace-scoped**: Automatically backs up the namespace where the NonAdminBackup resource is created
- **Simplified workflow**: No need to specify `--include-namespaces` - it uses your current kubectl context
- **Permission-aware**: Works within the permissions of the current user/service account
- **Integration with OADP**: Leverages the underlying Velero infrastructure managed by OADP operator

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive CLI integration tests organized by functionality.

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Standard Go pattern (also works)
go test ./...
```

## Development

This CLI is built using:
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for CLI framework
- [Velero client libraries](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) for core functionality  
- [OADP NonAdmin APIs](https://github.com/migtools/oadp-non-admin) for NonAdminBackup operations
